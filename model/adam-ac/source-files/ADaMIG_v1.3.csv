Often one ANLzzFL will serve to support the accurate selection of records for more than one analysis. Note that it is allowable to add additional descriptive text to the label (see Section 3.1.6, Additional Information about Section 3, Item 1). \n When defining the set of records used in a particular analysis or family of analyses, ANLzzFL is supplemental to, and is intended to be used in conjunction with, other selection variables, such as subject-level, parameter-level and record-level population flags, AVISIT, DTYPE, grouping variables such as SITEGRy, and others. The lower-case letter ""zz"" in the variable name is an index for the zzth record selection algorithm where ""zz"" is replaced with a zero-padded two-digit integer [01-99]. Every record selection algorithm ""zz"" (i.e., every algorithm for populating an ANLzzFL) must be defined in variable metadata. When the set of records that the algorithm ""zz"" operates on is pre-filtered by application of other criteria, such as a record-level population flag, then the selection algorithm definition in the metadata must so specify. \n Note that the ANLzzFL value of Y indicates that the record fulfilled the requirements of the algorithm, but does not necessarily imply that the record was actually used in one or more analyses, as whether or not a record is used also depends on the other selection variables applied. The ANLzzFL flag is useful in many circumstances; an example is when there is more than one record for an analysis timepoint within a subject and parameter, as it can be used to identify the record chosen to represent the timepoint for an analysis. ""zz"" is an index for a record selection algorithm, such as ""record closest to target relative day for the AVISIT, with ties broken by the latest record, for each AVISIT within <list of AVISITS>."" \n Note that it is not required that a specific ANLzzFL variable has the same definition across a project or even across datasets within a study.
